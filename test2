Here is another test. I am confident I can write this file in gvim, then upload it to github. This is pretty exciting. Its really cool to actually have this basic setup figured out. And pretty inspiring too. That means that I can start to really collaborate with people. It also is impressively easy how quickly you can install things from github with git. Very satisfying.
